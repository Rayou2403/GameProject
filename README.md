# GameProject - Ascend

## Overview

Ascend is a game inspired by the mechanics of Celeste, build using C and SDL2.
The focus of this project is on mastering precision platforming, smooth physics, 
and advanced collision detection to create a challenging and fluid gameplay experience.

## Project Goals

- Develop a custom physics engine for character movement (jumping,climbing,sliding)
- Implement a robust collision detection system with platforms and objects
- Develop an original game design
- Design an advanced camera system that dynamically follows the player
- Integrate fluid animations for character actions (running,jumping...)


## Requirements

- SDL2
- C Compiler
- Makefile

## Features in Progress

- Movement system 
- Collision with objects
- Dynamic level creation (files)
- Automatic camera control
- Character animations
